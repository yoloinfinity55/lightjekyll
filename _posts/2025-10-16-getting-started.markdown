Perfect! The server is running now! âœ…

```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Now open your browser and go to:

**http://localhost:4000**

or

**http://127.0.0.1:4000**

You should see your LightJekyll site with:
- Homepage with your post list
- "Welcome to Jekyll" post
- About page
- Your custom site title and description

---

**While the server is running:**

- Any changes you make to posts or pages will automatically rebuild
- You'll see "Regenerating..." messages in the terminal when files change
- If you edit `_config.yml`, you'll need to restart the server (Ctrl+C, then `bundle exec jekyll serve` again)

Your site is live! ðŸŽ‰
