Excellent! Your Jekyll site is up and running! ðŸŽ‰

Your site is now live at **http://127.0.0.1:4000/** (same as localhost:4000)

## What just happened:

âœ“ Jekyll generated your static site in the `_site` directory  
âœ“ The server is watching for file changes (auto-regeneration enabled)  
âœ“ You have 1 default post: "Welcome to Jekyll"

## About those deprecation warnings:

The Sass warnings are coming from the Minima theme and won't affect your site's functionality. They're just warnings about future Dart Sass 3.0.0 changes. Your site works perfectly fine.

## Next steps:

1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:4000 to see your site

2. **Create your first custom post:**
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal tab (keep the server running)
   cd /Users/minijohn/Documents/github-repo/lightjekyll
   code _posts/2025-10-16-my-first-post.markdown
   ```

3. **Edit `_config.yml`** to personalize your site:
   ```bash
   code _config.yml
   ```
   Change the title, email, and description. Remember to restart the server after changing this file (Ctrl+C, then `bundle exec jekyll serve` again).

4. **Make changes and watch them appear** - Any edits to posts or pages will automatically rebuild and refresh!

Your lightjekyll site is ready to customize. The guide in the artifact has all the details for working with themes, deployment, and more advanced features.
